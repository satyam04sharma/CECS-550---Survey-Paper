## Problem statement 
The paper "Robust and Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis via an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers" addresses the problem of polluted data and the limitations of classical L2-norm-based Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in the small sample size (SSS) scenario. When dealing with polluted data, minimizing the sum of squared errors may lead the projection vectors to drift from the desired directions, making LDA easily affected by outliers and noise. Additionally, classical L2-norm-based LDA may suffer from the SSS problem since it's difficult to evaluate the scatter matrix accurately in this situation.
